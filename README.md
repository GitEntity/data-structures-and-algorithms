# data structures and algorithms

### View branches for course work

This course provides the students with a solid foundation in data structures and their associated algorithms (e.g.
traversal, sorting, searching, element addition and removal) both from a theoretical, as well as practical
implementation perspective. The main objective of the course is to teach students how to select and design data
structures and algorithms that are appropriate for problems that they might encounter. The correctness and
computational complexities of the algorithms as related to the various data structures presented is also studied.
Topics covered are: analysis of algorithms, dictionaries, trees (balanced trees, binary-trees, spanning trees, etc.),
hashing, sorting, graphs, sets and maps, strings and pattern matching.
